### "Chaos game" is a "fractal player" on Javascript.

[Run HTML file](https://foobar167.github.io/page/chaos-game/chaos-game.html)
and control fractal drawing with your keyboard.
Pause, resume, forward and backward random fractal drawing
with {Space}, →, ←, ↑, ↓ keys. Turn on/off color mode with
{1} and {2} keys. Black-and-white drawing is faster.
